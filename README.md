# text_to_speech

1.) Edit the code and:
    
    a.) Insert text into the part that says ENTER TEXT HERE (line 4)

    b.) Choose a desired bitrate. 320 is default because I'm an audiophile

    c.) Enter the desired output filename for the audiobook

2.) Run. The file will be output in the current directory
